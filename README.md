# E-Commerce-Data-Cleaning-Visualization-Dashboard

This project involves analyzing multiple e-commerce datasets by performing data preprocessing, cleaning, and transformation using Python (Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn). I handled missing values by imputing or replacing them, converted date and timestamp columns into proper datetime formats, and ensured data consistency. Exploratory data analysis was carried out with KDE plots, count plots, and sunburst charts to visualize customer distribution across states and cities, as well as trends in orders and reviews. After cleaning and preparing the data, I integrated it into Power BI using Python scripts, where I created an interactive dashboard. The dashboard provides insights into customer behavior, order timelines, product categories, and regional sales trends, enabling data-driven decision-making for business growth.
